### admin

a basic app, designed for admin purposes

```
- sample patterns
- common configs
- modern libs
- qualified modules
- basic functionality
```

#### intent

to create a nice starting point for spinning up new admin apps


#### why?

I have found that most of the other boilerplate starter kits to be overwhelming in size and functionality. I don't want the kitchen sink for my next app, I just want a very basic scaffold that can be easily cloned, installed, and boots up quick with minimal configuration.
